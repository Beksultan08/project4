        <h1>Apennines</h1>
<h2>Geography </h2>
<p class="first">The chain between two seas forms, roughly speaking , an arc between the Gulf of Genoa , on the Mediterranean Sea and Naples on the Tyrrhenian Sea , the center of the arc approaching the east coast, at the level of Rimini ( Adriatic Sea ). The Apennines, however, have low-altitude mountain bastions which are not geographically located in the chain. These isolated mountainous formations among the hills belong to the Anti-Apennine group (the equivalent of the Prealps in the Alps). We can cite in particular the metalliferous hills , Monte Conero, the Alban mountains, the Lepins mountains., Circeo, Gargano, Vesuvius. The highest point is the Corno Grande , in the Gran Sasso massif in Abruzzo , with its 2,912 meters above sea level.</p>
<h3>Hydrography</h3>
<p>Only one glacier still remains in the Apennines: the Calderone glacier . It is generally considered to be the southernmost in Europe. It is located in a glacial cirque on the northern slope of Corno Grande . There are also snowfields over a more or less large area which may persist for several years.</p>

<h3>Geology</h3>
<p>Geographically, the Apennines are partly contiguous with the Alps. The two chains are often considered to be part of a single Alps-Apennine system.
In fact, the Alps were born millions of years before the Apennines emerged from the sea. Both chains are mainly formed of sedimentary rocks deposited in ancient Tethys, in the Mesozoic. The northward movement of the African Plate, its collision with the Eurasian Plate and the subduction of Africa under Europe are the causes of the Alpine orogeny , which began at the end of the Mesozoic, this orogenic belt ranging from Spain to Asia in an east-west direction, and including the Alps.</p>

<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>The climate is classified, for the vast majority of the massif, Mediterranean (according to the Köppen classification which classifies the region in Csa and Csb). But on high peaks like Corno Grande , the climate is mountainous .</p>

<h3>Extension area</h3>
<p>The western side of the peninsula is formed by a horst and grabens system , where the earth's crust, stretched by the extension of the mantle below it, thinned and shattered along a series of lines of faults substantially parallel, and the blocks of this bark have been alternately driven and lifted by the isostatic thrust . This tectonic type, predominant from Corsica , in the east, to the valley of the Tiber , in the west, has formed mountain ranges and intra-mountain basins in directions more or less perpendicular to the extension. The mountain ranges generated by the folds are formed of large anticlines in the heart of the highest and most extensive massifs of the Apennines, in the eastern sector. Lower although having steeper slopes, the mountain ranges created by the faults are not considered to be part of the Apennines, geographically, but are called “Subapennines” or “Anti-Apennines”. These latter mountains are found mainly in Tuscany , Campania and Lazio .</p>
